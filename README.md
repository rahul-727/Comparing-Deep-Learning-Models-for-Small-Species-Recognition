# Comparing-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Small-Species-Recognition

Conducted an exhaustive analysis of two prominent convolutional neural network (CNN) models, ResNet50 and VGG16, leveraging a dataset comprising 24,673 camera trap images. The objective was to enhance species identification accuracy across 20 distinct species, vital for wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts.

Through meticulous experimentation and model tuning, I developed a novel hybrid approach by integrating a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with ResNet50, capitalizing on the strengths of both methodologies. The results were impressive, with ResNet50 achieving a remarkable classification accuracy exceeding 99%, closely followed by VGG16 at 98.44%. The hybrid ResNet50-SVM model further demonstrated its efficacy by achieving an outstanding accuracy rate of 98.70%.

This breakthrough underscores the power of deep learning in revolutionizing wildlife monitoring and species identification techniques, offering unparalleled reliability and precision in ecological research and conservation programs. By surpassing traditional methods, such as manual identification or rule-based algorithms, this approach significantly advances our ability to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.
